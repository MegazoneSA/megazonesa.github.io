Branding of attractions is very inconsistent. I noticed you changing them a
lot, but the following variations are still present in various places:

- Blastzone, Blastzone Rides, Shooting Gallery, Blastzone Shooting Gallery
- Retro Video Games, Retrozone Arcade, Retrozone Arcade Games, Retro Arcade,
  Retro Gaming, Retro Gaming Room, Retro Video Game Room
- Driftzone Dodgems, Bumper Cars, Bumper Car Ride
- Laserzone, Laser Tag, Lasertag

The original site images have two different versions for each one at different
sizes. You can see the difference with these two:

- http://megazone.net.au/images/slider/3.jpg
- http://megazone.net.au/images/slider/3-lg.jpg

Frankly there isn't much difference. The main concern is that the aspect
ratios are slightly different, because there is some cropping/repositioning
going on, so a flat rescale isn't entirely appropriate. (That's what I did
with the pictures you provided.) It's not really noticeable, but whoever you
got to do those pictures should be aware that there are two different versions
of each.

Where do you want the tripadvisor link placed? I put it on the /our-location page.

# Parties

The first two dot points in catered/uncatered sports/kids parties ("20 minutes
in Retrozone", "Mission Briefing") swap places randomly. I've put the 20
minutes retrozone first in all of them since I assume that's how things play
out (ppl goof around in lobby area for 20 minutes until everyone arrives, then
brief everyone).

# Schools

The following paragraph was deleted. Not sure if intended, since other
deletions were explicitly indicated, but the paragraph does seem out of place.

> Laser Tag is a sport played at the National and International level. We are
> lucky enough to have local players with many years of National and
> International experience. There is a thriving Laser Tag competition and
> playing scene here at Megazone Noarlunga that can help any youngster who
> enjoys the sport of Laser Tag.

There are two copies of this section in your changes document which contradict each other:

- The first package is $27 in the first and $28 in the second. Assumed $28
  because of hourly pass image.
- "All Schools get the special price of $7 per person, per game." It's $5 in
  the second section. I've assumed $7 is correct, since that lines up with
  the package prices ($28 for 4 games = $7 per game).

# Holiday Programs

Packages are same as Schools section, except first package is $27. Assumed $28
because of hourly pass image.

Says "$x per person Package" whereas Schools section is just "$x package".
Which is intended?

Following paragraph was deleted. Not sure intended:
