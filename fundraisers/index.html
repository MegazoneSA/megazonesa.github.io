   <strong>Fundraisers</strong></h1>
<p class="lead">
   Are you a member of a not for profit organisation such as a school, sporting club or community organisation, and looking to raise funds?</p>
<p>
   Megazone Fundraisers are a perfect way to get the crew together for a good time AND raise some much needed funds for your organisation.</p>

<h2>
   What&#39;s Included</h2>
<p class="lead">
   Fundraiser events include the following 2 different options!</p>
<ul class="checklist">
   <li>
      $700 for unlimited lasertag and retro video games</li>
   <li>
      $900 for unlimited lasertag, retro video games, Arcades &amp; shooting gallery.
</ul>
<p>
   Book the centre for the night and then sell tickets to the event (usually around $27), keeping any profits that are made. You could make over $1000 in a single night!</p>
<p>
   To make it work you will need to be able to arrange a group of at least 30 people. Even though a group of 24 people will breakeven, a group of 30 will ensure that no one is out of pocket if a couple of people don&#39;t make it on the night.</p>
