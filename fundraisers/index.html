   <strong>Fundraisers</strong></h1>
<p class="lead">
   Are you a member of a not for profit organisation such as a school, sporting club or community organisation, and looking to raise funds?</p>
<p>
   Megazone Fundraisers are a perfect way to get the crew together for a good time AND raise some much needed funds for your organisation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>
   What&#39;s Included</h2>
<p class="lead">
   Fundraiser events include 3 hours of unlimited Laserzone, Retrozone Arcade Games, 1 Free Driftzone Dodgems ride per person ($3 extra Dodgems) up to 120 people.</p>
<p>
   To book the centre for the night is only $500. You then sell tickets to the event (usually around $20 - $25), keeping any profits that are made. You could make over $1000 in a single night!</p>
<p>
   To make it work you will need to be able to arrange a group of at least 40 people. Even though a group of 30 people will breakeven, a group of 30 will ensure that no one is out of pocket if a couple of people don&#39;t make it on the night.</p>
