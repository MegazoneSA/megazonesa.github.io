   If you love your Laser tag, you need to play at Megazone. The management behind the centre are keen Laser Tag enthusiasts, and strive to keep the laser equipment and arena at a World Class standard.</p>
<p>
   To continue developing Megazone Noarlunga as the most up to date and player focussed Laser Tag center in Noarlunga, we have recently installed the latest generation Helios Laser Tag equipment. The new gear is amazing. It has the same sleek Nexus vest that we love, but with a new phasor that brings touch screen technology, a large 20mm laser beam and weapon select functions to the fore. Much more information is now available to players during a game such as individual and team scores, time left, special abilities and the avatar of the player that just tagged you!</p>
<p>
   In order to make the Laser Tag experience even more interactive we have recently added 40 targets to the arena that activate during the game and give players access to extra points or special abilities. This has created a whole new level of arena interactivity, particularly for smaller groups with less players to tag.</p>
<p>
   The arena is a popular competition Laser Tag arena, and will be host to the 2017 Australasian Laser Tag Championships. It&#39;s the kind of arena you&#39;ll never get bored with and is so much fun to play for adults or kids.</p>
<p>
   If you are new to Laser Tag, find out more about it in our FAQ. All you need to bring is enclosed footwear to play. Some players like to wear dark clothing to conceal better in the dimly lit playing environment, but this is optional.</p>

   Look forward to seeing you at Megazone Noarlunga! See Prices &amp; Packages for up to date price information.</p>

   The new Megazone Driftzone Dodgems have been a hit. People love the cars at Megazone Noarlunga. We keep the track nice and slippery, so there is plenty of drifting and speed as you whizz around and crash in to your friends.</p>
<p>
   You need to be 120cm to drive. You will need enclosed footwear to ride the Driftzone Dodgems.</p>

   Welcome to the one of a kind - and first to Adelaide - Blastzone Shooting Gallery!</p>
<p>
   The Blastzone Shooting Gallery is a new dark room area where 4 players can battle over 5 rounds to see who get the highest points!</p>
<p>
   Each round has a different objective, eg. &quot;Shoot all the red targets to win!&quot;</p>
<p>
   This is a great way to practice your aim before a Laserzone game!!</p>
