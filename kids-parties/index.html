      Megazone Birthday parties are easy, low-fuss and great value. From the time you arrive to the time you leave, your party will be busy enjoying the centre and having the time of their lives. As the organiser, you get to kick back and enjoy the ride. All you need to do is book, organise a cake, and get the kids to Megazone on the day!

      Upon arrival you will be greeted by one of our friendly staff and shown to your own party room. You will have your own space for the duration of the party and once we have finalised your options, you can take a break and watch the magic happen.
   <p>
      The first 20 minutes of the party is spent in the Retro Gaming Room so if anyone is late or stuck in traffic, they will not miss out on any Laser Tag. Your party will then play the first game of Laser tag. If you would like to join in, one parent can play for FREE in each of the Laser Tag games, if there are spaces available. The party will then spend 40 minutes having food, cake, presents and singing happy birthday to the party  person! There are two awesome options to choose from, The Self Catered party option, perfect for kids with allergies or the no fuss Catered party option where all you need to do is bring the cake! Then the party will play the final game of Laser Tag followed by any extras, such as Bumper Cars, Laser Tag or Shooting Gallery.

   <p>
      We have two party options, the self-catered <a href="kids-parties#Mega-party"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">Mega Party</span></a> and the <a href="kids-parties#catered-Mega-party"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">Catered Mega Party</span></a>.</p>
