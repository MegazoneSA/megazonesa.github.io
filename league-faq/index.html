      <h2>
         How old do I need to be?</h2>
      <p>
         Players should be at least 12 years of age before starting League and 8 for junior league, this can change if kids are taller though.</p>
      <h2>
         Do I need to bring a team or can I join by myself?</h2>
      <p>
         You are welcome to join by yourself, with a friend or 2, or as a full team of 5.&nbsp;Previous experience has shown that full teams of 5 who intend to play together develop quicker by splitting in their first season or 2, so that they can be shown the ropes by a couple of experienced players, and then re-forming once they are a little more experienced.</p>
