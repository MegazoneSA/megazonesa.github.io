         The nature of the game means that height, size or gender has no impact on your ability to have a fair exchange in the game and enjoy the experience. It evens the playing field. And has a surprising impact on communication between people and team mates.</p>

   Each week when the class arrives, we take them and get them loaded and started in the games. Teachers enjoy bringing the kids because it&#39;s so easy, and the kids love it so much. We can give your class individual player cards so that they can track their progress throughout the term or semester.</p>
