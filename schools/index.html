         Did you know that you can travel up to 1km in a single game of Laser Tag? Laser Tag is a surprisingly athletic, and team oriented game that appeals to kids who don&#39;t play traditional sports.</p>
      <p>
         The nature of the game means that height, size or gender has no impact on your ability to have a fair exchange in the game and enjoy the experience. It evens the playing field. And has a surprising impact on communication between people and team mates.</p>

   Each week when the class arrives, we take them and get them loaded and started in the games. Teachers enjoy bringing the kids because it&#39;s so easy, and the kids love it so much. We can give your class individual player cards so that they can track their progress throughout the term or semester.</p>

<p>
   Schools who book for 1 term receive a special Rec Sports price of $10 for 2 games. This will take around 45min to 1hr to complete. If we have time for a 3rd game we will always squeeze one in.</p>
